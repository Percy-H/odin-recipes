        <h2>Red wine with a kick!</h2>
        <p>If you know, you know, and if you don't, you're about to. Vin Mariani, or <i>Vin Tonique Mariani Ã  la Coca de Peroum</i> if you want to get all French about it, was a "tonic wine" on the market between 1816 and ~1910.</p>
        <p>What was the kick in this tonic, beloved by royals, celebrities, and at least one Pope? <em>Cocaine</em>. of course.</p>
        <p>Obviously, you can't buy this stuff today, and we certainly do not condone the breaking of any laws. <em>however</em>...</p>
        <p>Vin Mariani traditionally contained 6g ground coca per glass, so, assuming a standard 5 oz/glass, one would need:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5  oz red Bordeaux</li>
            <li>30mg ground coca leaves, ground very fine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour a glass of Bordeaux.</li>
            <li>Stir in ground coca leaves.</li>
            <li>Let sit for some amount of time to properly infuse. The recipe was of course proprietary, so let's just assume the relevant alkaloid is fairly soluble in ethanol and give it half an hour.</li> 
            <li>19<sup>th</sup> century Popes aside, we've long passed the vale of respectability. Drink up, buttercup.</li>
