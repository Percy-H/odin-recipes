        <h2>Eggs poached in spicy tomato sauce</h2>
        <p>A simple, hearty breakfast dish. Can also be made in a more italian style if you prefer that flavor profile.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>5 Anaheim chiles or 3 jalapeños, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed then sliced</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, with juice</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add chiles and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, about 6 minutes.</li>

            <li>Put tomatoes and their liquid into a medium bowl and crush with your hands.</li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes and their liquid to skillet along with 1/2 cup water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Season sauce with salt.</li>
            <li>Crack eggs over sauce so that eggs are evenly distributed across sauce's surface.</li>
            <li>Cover skillet and cook until yolks are just set, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, baste the whites of the eggs with tomato mixture, being careful not to disturb the yolk.</li>
