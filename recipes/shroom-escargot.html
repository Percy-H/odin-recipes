        <h2>Garlic butter roasted mushrooms</h2>
        <p>So this is simple as hell; it's basically just mushrooms roasted in garlic and butter with some parsley and lemon juice. You can think of it a vegetarian escargot, but it's really its own thing. No need for fancy airs.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb brown button mushrooms, halved if large </li>
            <li>2 tbsp capers if you like capers. I usually leave them out.</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter, cut in pieces</li>
            <li>2 tsp fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle.</li>
            <li>Toss mushrooms with capers, garlic, oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a 1½- to 2-qt shallow baking dish.</li>
            <li>Top with butter and roast 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden and bubbly garlic sauce forms below.</li> 
            <li>Stir in lemon juice and parsley. Serve immediately, with crusty bread for sopping up the juices.</li>        
        </ol>
