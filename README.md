# Odin Recipes Project
This repository is for my early foray into the Odin Project, specifically the example recipe site. Expect it to look scuffed at this point, as the current lesson is focussed on html; css will (possibly) come later.

It should be noted that I deviated a bit from the template, and I do *not* have only myself to blame; I blame ancient aliens.
